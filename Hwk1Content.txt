The use of online learning has greatly increased in the last decade, especially at the college and university level. A student’s learning strategy, the way the student goes about managing her time and resources. 
It is thought that students who take a more active role in managing their time and energy over the fifteen week semester will be more likely to succeed. In educational literature, this management behavior is referred to “meta-cognitive” or “executive function.” It is the thinking one does about how to accomplish a task and monitoring one’s progress while making any necessary changes to keep “on track.” 

Important qualities of strategic behavior are: 
•	Timeliness: a sense of awareness of when coursework must be completed and how much time should be allocated to learn the material adequately. Timeliness can be measured by the distribution of work submitted before a due date. 
•	Thoroughness: a measure of how much of the assigned work is completed. Another indication of this quality is the degree to which past due material is revisited, as in a review for an upcoming exam. Yet another way to gauge thoroughness is how students interact with the teachable content in each instructional unit. For example, students are thorough if they read text passages, consider worked examples, participate in any interactive activities, and so forth. This kind of thoroughness is often sacrificed when students do not allow themselves time to fully experience the teachable content during the acquisition phase.
•	Persistence: how much effort is expended to solve difficult problems? One measure of persistence is how soon does a student skip or abandon a challenging task. A record of the number of attempts and the time intervals between them as well as help-seeking activity can provide information about the quality of the “persistence”. One way help seeking may occur is in collaboration with peers. This may be measured by survey questions, or by mining LMS data for patterns of usage that suggest collaboration.
•	Efficiency: how well does a student use the time they spend in the system? One measure of efficiency is the ratio of attempts at solving a problem vs. time. Efficiency is a result of strategic thinking: if the material is studied in the acquisition phase, i.e. the textbook is read, working on homework problems should be more efficient in terms of time, especially for novice students. Help seeking at the right time can improve efficiency. 
•	Sequencing: the order in which a student works on course material. For example, read a text passage before attempting homework problems versus working homework problems and accessing the text concurrently. The same sequence observed on successive modules implies that the student has a plan for working through the course. A specific plan is provided by the course syllabus and often enforced by due dates. This is an “ideal” plan, but is it a good plan for all students, or are there subpopulations for which there are better plans? Is it better to have a consistent plan then no plan? Is it good to change plans?

3. Modify the title of the web page [the text that appears in the tab] by changing the text between the `<title>` and `</title>` tags to `Trillium Media Design`

4. Position your cursor in the body section and code the header element with the text, "Trillium Media Design in an h1 element element like so: 

    <header>
	<h1>Trillium Media Design</h1>
    </header>


5. Code a nav element to contain text that will indicate the main navigation for the website. Configure bold text using the b element and use the `&nbsp` special character (which stands for Nonbreaking space) to add extra blank space like so: 
<pre>
<nav>
	<b>Home &nbsp; Services &nbsp; Contact</b>
</nav>
</pre>

6. Code the content within a div element that contains the h2 and paragraph elements. 
<pre>

</footer>
</pre>

Replace "Your Name Here" with your actual name.
